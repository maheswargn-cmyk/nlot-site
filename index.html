<h2>About NLOT</h2>
<p>
The 13.7-m National Large Optical–Infrared Telescope (NLOT) is India’s next-generation flagship ground-based astronomical facility, designed to place the country at the forefront of global observational astronomy. Located at the Indian Astronomical Observatory in Hanle, Ladakh, NLOT will provide unprecedented sensitivity, angular resolution, and spectroscopic capability in the optical and infrared regimes.
With nearly fifteen times the collecting area of India’s existing 4-m class telescopes and advanced adaptive optics for diffraction-limited performance in the infrared, NLOT will enable transformative science across astrophysics while ensuring sustained national access to a world-class facility.

<h2>Why NLOT Matters</h2>
  <p> Modern astronomy is driven by large multi-wavelength facilities such as JWST, LSST, SKA, and gravitational-wave observatories. To fully exploit discoveries from these missions, deep and rapid optical–infrared follow-up is essential. NLOT is designed to serve precisely this role — acting as a national “force multiplier” that maximizes India’s scientific return from global investments in astronomy and space science. 
The telescope will also ensure long-term access for Indian researchers, complementing India’s participation in international facilities like the Thirty Meter Telescope, while enabling discovery-driven science aligned with national priorities.</p>
